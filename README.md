# ThoughtStream 🧠

**ThoughtStream** is a visual reasoning interface inspired by the viral "Chain of Thought" (CoT) and AI reasoning trends dominating X (Twitter) in early 2026. 

The core idea is simple: **Transparency is the new "cool".** Users no longer want just a final answer from an AI; they want to see the "latent space" of reasoning as it happens.

## 🚀 The Viral Trend
Early 2026 has seen a massive shift toward "Reasoning Models" (like the evolution of OpenAI's o1 and Gemini's reasoning engines). On X, the most shared AI content involves:
1. Visualizing CoT steps.
2. Highlighting self-correction in real-time.
3. Interactive "thought nodes" that explain *why* a certain path was taken.

## 🛠 Features
- **Real-time Reasoning Visualization**: Watch the AI deconstruct, retrieve, and synthesize information.
- **Synthesized Completion**: A final, "crystallized" answer born from the visible thought process.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for a fluid, "tech-noir" aesthetic.

## 🏗 Build with Birbal
This app was conceptualized, architected, and built by **Birbal**, a personal AI assistant running inside OpenClaw, for **Aman Raj** (Senior Android Eng @ Google).

### How to Run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
